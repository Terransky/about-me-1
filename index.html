        My Name is Anthony Williams. I am 25 years old. I am married to my
        highschool sweetheart Brittany Williams. I have 2 kids, 11 months and 4
        years old.

          >Cool fact about those three. I asked her out on april 13th of 2012...
          Which is Friday the 13th. I proposed to her on Cinco de Mayo. Her
          birthday is March 17th which is St.Patricks Day, and my oldest son's
          birthday is also March 17th...but 21 years later. BUT WAIT.... Theres
          more... My youngest son was conceived on the same day as my first son,
          But he was born 18 days prior... If you do the math that would
          technically be Feburary 28th 2020.... But those who didnt know, 2020
          was a leap year. So there was 29 days in Feburary. Yes, you guessed
          it. My Second son was born on Leap Day of Leap Year. That means he
          would only have 1 birthday every 4 years, in turn meaning when he
          turned 84, he would be turning 21. So... That means he can not drink
          until he is 84 years old.</b>
          
        Will all of that being said you're probably wondering where i come in. I
        was born August 5th. Nothing special right? Wrong. The band named "The
        Beatles", Ya? You know them... They released there top selling, most
        sucessfull and money producing album on my birthday. Not just the day
        guys, the Year too... 1995!!!! Thats special enough for me! I was born
        in Florida and raised in Maine. My mother passed away in 2007 when i was
        11. She passed of Metastatic Melanoma, which now is one of the ONLY
        cancers that can be cured in Stage 4. 10 years to late, huh? I than
        moved to Colorado, where i met my gorgeous wife, graduated Highschool
        and enlisted for the Army. I Went to basic, got married, and was
        stationed all in 2013. By 2015 I reclassed into Aviation and than
        deployed right after. Upon return from Deployment i was medically
        discharged. It made me really realize that i have to buck up and make a
        good career field and a simple life for my family. So i did. I am
        currently working full time as a system administrator for the department
        of defence. i am also currently holding a spot in the upcoming
        Spaceforce Software Development team that is being developed as we
        speak. When I graduate from Code Fellows 401 class with a focus on
        Python, i will fall into my Software Development spot and than work for
        the Department of Defence as a Gaurdian of the Galaxy. This is where i
        pose like Superman.
